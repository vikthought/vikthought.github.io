<p>I find that to those whom change educational insitutions, or any embark on any change in scenery throughout life, will come accustomed to meeting new people. I place particular emphasis one educational insitutions of the simple reason that these insitutions require students to use a rather ficle skill: collaboration.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is with that skill that I find much to be amazing. Yet, simulatenously, I find that skill to lead to much grievance. There was a man who lived many years ago. He was the director of psychology at the University of Michigan. He was a fasinating man. When he met a new person, instead of the conventional american small talk: "What do you do for a living". He would ask his newly formed aquanitecs "Do you believe euthenasia to be just?".</p>
<p>Further, this man was a highly acclaimed researcher in the field of happiness. He had set a great degree of his life on a trejectory to understand what is Happiness. If one is to say he was an odd figure, they wouldn't be wrong. But that only be because the idea of asking such questions in today's society is rather shunned. We find that meeting new people, and further, striking such conversation with said people, must have topics that live on the surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do we meet people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To build a connection, no? We connect with those we can share with. But is sharing your social media profile really sharing? If it was, I'd say that it would be rather weird then that every social media compny still tries to obtain more data from their users every single day.</p>
<p>And it is for this reason that I had previously mentioned the good professor. He was a man who had realized happiness, which arrived from connection, comes when people are willing to talk about the ideas, the questions, the real existential issues, which we do not share across easily. It's hard. But as is with so many hard things, completely worthwhile.</p>
<p>And is for that reason, I titled this post Undergraduate Grievances. Since every undergraduate I have met talks with the ficade of a Social Media. That is my Grievance. And I hope whomever reads this embarks to change this norm. Not only amongst students, but any interaction with strangers.</p>
<p>As the ancient proverb says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having fun conversations is fun.</p>
</blockquote>
