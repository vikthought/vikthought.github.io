</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>The Future of Tech Post-Pandemic</h2>
<p>Pandemic has solidified the need for "robust telecommunications"prioritizing:
* Security
* Strength
* Prosperity</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything needs a Remote <em>Option</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Business:
Video Communication and Collaboration is the new status quo</p>
<p>Learning:
Learning Online is the Norm, and the option likely won't be going away</p>
<p>Healthcare:
Telehealth is rapidly accelerating too.</p>
<p>Industry:
Everything needs to be automated. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the pandemic;s biggest business ipacts have been in supply chain management and asset tracking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Entertainment has completely changed. Hollywood is Digital, not the box office. And the bars, concerts etc. have changed to video too.</p>
<p>"The Remote X world":
In a nutshell: Everyone should get fast reliable network connections. The cloud will play a vital part in this world.</p>
<p>IIOT (Internet of things) will even change the workplace. Trackers, detectors, etc. will be used to make sure everyone isn't sick.</p>
<p>(Security will become even better as a result too.)</p>
<h3>Future of Innovation:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Our post-pandemic world will require new types of technology that can facilitate creativity and augment human intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Cobots</em> will be available online to help automate as much as possible.</p>
<p>Innovation will test the balance of security (health-based) and privacy (chinese human trackers used in Covid)</p>
<p>5G will be taken full advantage of. </p>
<p>Questions are:
* What will change as a result of 5G (aside from self-driving of course)
* What new careers will emerge?
* What careers will go away?
* What's going to be invented?
* How is the government going to get involved?</p>
