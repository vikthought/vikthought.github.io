<p>Today, we know more about the world then we ever have in human history. However, knowledge with all of its virtues, has vices too. These shortcoming arise in the inevitable outcome of new knowledge. New knowledge always leads to new questions. But these new questions, by pure virtue of arising from the edges of knowledge are just as, if not more, difficult to answer.</p>
<p>For as long as society has existed, a defining feature of a society has been its faith. Faith fills the holes our curiosity leaves us with on our understanding of what it means to be human. Faith also leaves us with questions too, but I believe that is a topic better left for another day. Nevertheless, the power of faith is how it provides meaning, it makes an individual feel whole. But their is a danger  that lies in faith as well.</p>
<p>Scientific breakthroughs constantly leave us more with questions than answers. That can be thought of as both a good and bad thing. Yet, for many, these questions need answers. Take the example of the current anti-vax movement. For many of the people who were at the start of this movement, their feelings toward vaccines arose from the illnesses they or their loved ones obtained. These illnesses didn't have a known cause. Most of these same people are still waiting for someone to show them that cause.</p>
<p>Yet, as time goes on, the yearning for answers overwhelms. The yearning for answers becomes an itch that cannot go unscratched So what have people done? They've taken the theories of the causes, from some special food to some certain vaccine, and make an association. It's not that they want to cause the world to become less safe, they want answers.</p>
<p>Many people today think so distastefully of these people. As if they are uneducated, of some lower class, yet it's not them who have failed the rest of the world. The world has failed them. They are simply human beings whose unconscious need for a reason has led them down a certain path. </p>
<p>It's those paths that are dangerous. Not only because they can lead to vast numbers of people with improper understandings of what really is the truth. But also these paths lead to labels. The labeling of questions as good or bad. While ideas can be good or bad, questions deserve to be looked into. People deserve to look into what the effects of vaccines may be, what the causes of certain beliefs are, and what makes us think the way we do. </p>
<p>Many of the issues people say are the result of some lesser people are really the result of those dawning the labels on these same people. People must chose to look beyond the ideas one speaks to the cause of those ideas themselves. That is, in essence, looking to empathy. I hope you too choose to look in that direction.</p>                </article>
