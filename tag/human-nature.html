<p>It’s not as sad as it sounds. I promise.</p>
<p>At first glance, thinking of the optimal endgame of humanity seems to be a paradox within itself. To say for certain that there is anything optimal about having our species finish its time in the universe is, I admit, a stretch. But I ask you set aside your bias as we delve into the realm of speculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The future without speculation is, well, boring” — Anonymous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it would be better to establish a definite of endgame before we proceed further. I mean, how could one say for certain something is really ending. As the ancient proverb goes, “the end of one thing is the beginning of something.”</p>
<p>I find a satisfactory definition of endgame is a state where the sources of exploration, discovery and true change for humanity has ended. A state where humanity has ultimate finished progressing. And to those who require a definition, lets define progress as change caused by a desire for some sort of goal.</p>
<p>The Endgame
Now that we have an idea of what an endgame is in theory, let’s delve into the endgame of humanity.</p>
<p>As time progresses, one unavoidable fact is that technology will progress. Humanity will innovate more. There will be machines that can interact with our brain, those that can connect with our brain and maybe even manipulate our brain.</p>
<p>In time, the question of whether string theory was right or not will be the same as asking: do we orbit around the sun? We will have a rigorous understanding of nature. And if we have such an understanding, then we will have little to no mysteries left.</p>
<p>As the completion of our knowledge of all fundamental systems occurs, our ability to innovate will accelerate at rates faster than we could even imagine today. Our current time will be like the stone age. The world will truly be at our finger tips.</p>
<p>It is at that moment, if we were to reach it, that the question then becomes: what’s next. So, I ask you, what do you think? Well, if you’re stumped, here’s some possibilities.</p>
<h3>Possibility 1: The Happiness Machine.</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to be happy, right? Our current society has become so obsessed with this rather simple idea that it has even started to judge countries on a happiness scale. Suffice to say, happiness is a good thing.</p>
<p>Now, in our close to ending world, what if we had the ability to build a machine which could simulate happiness. In such a world, you could live forever thanks to the power of computers and the idea of a “downloaded” consciousness.</p>
<p>In such a world, wouldn’t you want happiness? And if you could get it, and you didn’t have to stop, wouldn’t you like the idea of perpetual happiness?Wouldn’t that be nice? Many would say so, Right?</p>
<p>In such a world, you could be happy forever. And because of the state of advancement, not just you, but everyone could be happy. That’s it. Humanity is accomplished. And by it being accomplished, it has ended. Both a Happy and Sad ending. Happy in the respect that everyone is indeed happy. Sad since it’s the end.</p>
<p>Well that’s one possibility, so I say let’s try another.</p>
<h3>Possibility 2: The Future Machine</h3>
<p>Now imagine this: humanity has now understood every law of nature, every aspect of the human brain, and, through technology, has the ability to know where every single tangible object is at every second. Humanity has accumulated all the knowledge on everything in the world and learned every rule that governs that knowledge.</p>
<p>Humanity has reached the point where we know how everything interacts with each other, and have the technology to simulate all of those interactions on a machine. That machine is the Future Machine.</p>
<p>With the future machine, anyone can know when anything will happen whenever it happens. Even if time machines are impossible, humanity has the potential to reach the point of a Future Machine.</p>
<p>And to those who impose that such a machine is impossible, you could be right. But under our current understanding of nature, we believe it to be governed by laws, so if we underrated everything of nature, I ask you to consider the plausibility of a such a machine being possible of existing.</p>
<p><em>So, what then? What happens next?</em></p>
<p>If humanity can know what will happen at any point in time in the future, what’s the purpose of living?</p>
<p>Even one’s time of death, the literal end of an individual chance at living, the one thing that we never truly knew the time of, would be common knowledge.</p>
<p>But its not even death that is the most shocking aspect of this. Imagine knowing at what times you will do something. You’re future: predetermined. You’re life: pages in a book. The mystery of what comes next: gone.</p>
<p>How would you consider life in such a scenario? Would you still find joy in it such a life? Would you still have a reason for living? Where would you find the drive to act? Where would you find the will to insight change. And don’t forget: in such a world where the Future Machine exists: there’s nothing left to discover. </p>
<p><em>There’s nothing left to explore.</em></p>
<p>If you’re are wondering how such a machine would cause be the Endgame, I ask that you remember that with the Future Machine, you can, in theory, know the end of humanity. And if you know the end, I would believe it would be fair to call such a scenario the Endgame, given the end is in sight.</p>
<h3>A Reflection on the Assumptions</h3>
<p>Though many more endgames can be theorized, I believe it best to halt our little thought experiment with two. As these two alone have relied on some assumptions of humanity that deserve their own discourse.</p>
<p>As, in the cases of the examples given above, I have assumed that humans do not attain a true “Free Will,” and have assumed that all actions are simply the byproduct of genetics and experiences.</p>
<p>I have not brought into such scenario the ideas of faith, as while I realize have hurt the feelings of St. Augustine, to bring in faith would require further abstractions that would have been, from my perspective, more complicated.</p>
<p>I have made the assumption that there is a set limit on the knowledge required to understand nature. While one could argue that once cannot truly know all of the laws of nature, per se, I chose to hypothesize that there is such a limit where all other knowledge is simply extensions of some finite limit that can be extrapolated when needed.</p>
<p>These assumptions are significant, but should not deter oneself from thinking deeply of such scenarios.</p>
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>We live in a world where we are constantly reminded of the volatile nature of our species. The numerous ways that we can end our society through harm to our environment and harm to our fellow humans. The likelihood of such means of harm leading to our demise is astronomically higher than the two endgame scenarios I have mentioned above.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the methods of harm that could cause our demise our in our control. So, if anything should drive one to solace after such negative thoughts, it is that we have the control over that much, and that we have the ability to convince others to change as well.</p>
<p>I hope one can seek to find pleasure in thinking of these “optimal” endgames. Since, as the proverb goes, “all things must come to an end.”</p>
<p>We know that there is an end that will come, but we have the ability to postpone it as much as possible.</p>
<p>Humanity has the remarkable ability to have foresight of such events that could cause our end. We can theorize scenarios that, though likely of occurring at some distant time, still leave us feeling happy and satisfied with what has been created and what has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Opening a discourse to such ideas of an optimal endgame can foster new perspectives on humanity, new flaws of our own society and ultimately new solutions to create a more well-lasting endgame for our species as a whole.</p>
<p>Every moment of everyday we are getting closer to such an Endgame, so I hope you will continue this discussion.</p>                </article>
