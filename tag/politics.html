</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>On the onset of a new presidency, half of the US is ecstatic while the other half is in dismay. </p>
<p>There’s one question on most pundits, pollsters and political junkies’ minds. How can we have a new president of a different party when the House, the body our framers intended to most closely represent us lean in the opposing party’s direction? </p>
<p>Well, the one policy Trump passed in his presidency that most directly affected the middle class was his tax cuts. And given the majority of Americans, from the founding of our nation till now don’t like taxes, it’s fair to say many Americans liked Trump’s policy.</p>
<p>While character is a different issue, what did Trump do? He showed a faction of the United States the power of tax cuts. And showed these same citizens that the GOP can keep taxes low. So, while his character was on the ballot, he gave the boost that the GOP needed to keep their supporters happy, and gather new supporters too. </p>
<p>Now, as we enter a Biden presidency, the message is clear. Those same supporters who gave Biden his presidency, haven’t forgotten the message of Trump’s Party. They know what the GOP can do for them. </p>
<p>What else did Trump do? He through information into the abyss that is the subconscious of the American public. He painted the picture of radical democrats and the battle for “law and order” in their minds. He has made the views of the Democratic Party for many will be different for many Americans going forward.</p>
<p>And now the greatest achievement of Trump’s presidency. Two words, “Fake News.” The beginning of a new chapter in American media, where twitter has achieved the status of the most credible source for a significant subset of the US population. </p>
<p>Can Biden reverse Trump’s policies. We’ll have to wait and see how the senate goes. But have the people spoken? Yes. They spoke in the lack of a Blue wave. And that means that the party of Lincoln has changed. Why? Because once an idea is introduced, it cannot die. </p>
<p>Trump has become not only an idea, but an ideal for many in this country. Biden has won the presidency, but his power is at the whim of Congress. In the House, his party lost seats. In the Senate, no major change has occurred (yet?)</p>
<p>Biden has an uphill battle to climb. Not only in sewing the rips of the fabric of our political discourse, but in the traditional challenges for any politician. He has to keep his base happy. He has to prove himself. And he has to make true on his policy.</p>
<p>What is special about his presidency is that his predecessor hasn’t just lost, he’s left a legacy more powerful than any portrait or policy. He’s energized a base only accountable to him. He’s enthralled the ideology of the most powerful group in American politics, independents. He hasn’t just changed America; he has changed her electorate.</p>
<p>So, is the US a different country now from four years ago? Yes. Was it because of Trump? Yes. Will It go back to pre-2016 conditions? Probably not.</p>                </article>
