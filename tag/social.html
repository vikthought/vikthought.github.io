</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This is likely one of the most confusing constructs I think our society has ever created. </p>
<p>My personal take has always been that if you have talked to someone and are on friendly terms, they can be regarded as Acquaintances. If you see the person on a regular basis in some professional enviorment, they can be regarded as peers or coworkers. And then comes the mystical concept: friend. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a Friend?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I do not ask this in hopes of creating some poetic definition. If you can tell from my previous writings, I would much rather have an interesting discussion on the true meaning of a friend. And like most things, to understand what something is, one must understand how something is firstly created. </p>
<p>So the question becomes: how does one create a friend. From my own research and experience, I believe it has to do with two things. A mutual connection on the basis of some shared interest. And the second thing is that there requires some sort of trigger. I use this trigger as placeholder. As my question is what really is this trigger?</p>
<p>people are constantly becomming friends, and while I agree friendship requires maintance in some way, shape or form, the trigger I believe is the key to truly understanding what lies at the base of the 21st century social construct of friend.</p>
<p>What fasciantes me is the idea that the trigger can be created by one of the two persons involved, or some outside force. Yet that does make me wonder, is a friendship more meaningful if we have some outside force act as the basis for the formation of the friendship?</p>
<p>It appears today that the idea of groups, which is likely the most powerful outside trigger, is not normally the product of one of the two parties causing the initiation. But then again, groups must begin from somewhere. </p>
<p>I believe that understanding this will further help those who find fall into the extrovert friend fallacy. A fallacy where outgoing people lack the catalyst of outside triggers to allow for easy initation into friend groups and friendships.</p>
<p>It requires not one to have a particular nature, whether that be extroverted or outgoing, to acquire friends. But instead, it requires that the possibility of triggers remains everso present in such person's life that the ability to form such relationships can occur with ease.</p>
<p>A fallacy worth taking to heart when one views the world.</p>                </article>
