</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I would like to propose legislation that could solve the problem of regulating technology companies control of received information. I believe that the government should mandate that all algorithms responsible for selecting the content user's receive on their "feed" should be open-source. 
This would mean that these algorithms would be transparent to the public for scrutiny by academics and media organizations. Any bias that may be present can be regulated by the most powerful force in US society, public scrutiny. This would also allow for public suggestions as to how to improve the algorithms and reduce bias. All of this could occur without the need for the government to update regulations as technology changes.
The proposed legislation would also incite competition in the technology industry by allowing smaller technology companies to have a greater chance at competing with the tech giants. Having these algorithms kept as trade secrets is the same as a pharmaceutical company denying to share the molecular structure of their drugs. These algorithms impact that lives of billions of people, yet they are not subject to the same transparency that almost all other commercial products are subject to.
I hope you consider looking into this further. As with the increased prevalence of these algorithms in the lives of millions of Americans: the need for scrutiny and transparency is at an all time high. The bias can be solved when everyone can see what's behind the curtain.</p>                </article>
