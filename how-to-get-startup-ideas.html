<p>To start: The best way to get a good startup idea isn't to think of ideas, but to look for problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Beware</em> of the sitcom idea. An idea that nobody wants (or nobody will <em>pay</em> for)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If"you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount <em>Choose the latter.</em> "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad.</p>
<p><em>You normally can't tell if there;s a path out fo an idea. A lot of global companies started out as Niche products. i.e. Airbnb, OpenTable etc.</em></p>
<p>"So if you can't predict whether there's a path out of an idea, how do you choose between ideas? The truth is disappointing but interesting: if you're the right sort of person, you have the right sort of hunches."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BUT, you don;t always have to be at the leading edge of a feild. You can also be at the leading edge of a customer. In other words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Live in the future, then build what's missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not "think up" but <em>"notice."</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no recipe for starup ideas. The key is to have your mind prepared in the right way to notice these ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Author's Note: "You don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that's changing fast. Other domains change fast. But while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future sufficient. As Marc Andreessen put it, software is eating the world, and this trend has decades left to run."</p>
<p>Summary of the above: Coding is helpful. But remember, the most important part is having the properly prepared mind.</p>
<h4>The act of noticing</h4>
<p>One needs to constantly ask themselves: "What's Missing"</p>
<p>And remeber, there's always more ideas out there, not matter how hard it may seem.</p>
<p>Patience is needed, and Toys (ideas that are cool just not important) can have potential</p>
<p>If you can afford to take a long view (and arguably you can't afford not to), you can turn "Live in the future and build what's missing" into something even better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Live in the future and build what seems interesting.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Some Notes about school.</h5>
<p>Don't study entrepreneurship, its something you learn best by doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you should be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take classes in a lot of different fields. Intern at different places, not necessarily just software. Good thing to do: Build things.</p>
<p>Beware of research. It's not as likely as a side project to become a startup because of the intentions behind it.</p>
<h5>And now a discussion on competition and other things too.</h5>
<p>"Because a good idea should seem obvious, when you have one you'll tend to feel that you're late. Don't let that deter you. Worrying that you're late is one of the signs of a good idea."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"If you have something that no competitor does and that some subset of users urgently need, you have a beachhead. The question then is whether that beachhead is big enough."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two more filters you'll need to turn off if you want to notice startup ideas: the unsexy filter and the schlep filter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schlep Filter is basically allowing oneself to stop focusing on the startup ideas that involve writing code, putting it on a server, and watching the money role in. That concept is the convenient startup idea.</p>
<p>"the space of convenient startup ideas has been stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few blocks down the street to the messy, tedious ideas, you'll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious. Your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps. That's schlep blindness.</p>
<p>How do you overcome schlep blindness? Frankly, the most valuable antidote to schlep blindness is probably ignorance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Recipes (AKA Shortcuts?)</h4>
<p>Though the organic strategy of idea formulation is better, here's some tips.</p>
<p>Remember, however, that when thinking of startup ideas non-organically, one requires much more self-discipline.</p>
<p>One should constantly ask themselves about problems they have, or have seen others have. </p>
<p>"I recommend to people who need a new idea is not merely to turn off their schlep and unsexy filters, but to seek out ideas that are unsexy or involve schleps. - Make something unsexy that people will pay you for.""</p>
<p>Ask yourself: What would you pay for right now?</p>
<p><em>Look at industries/companies that are dying, see if you can profit from their demise</em></p>
<p>Don't look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a replacement for x. i.e. Traditional journalism, for example, is a way for readers to get information and to kill time, a way for writers to make money and to get attention, and a vehicle for several different types of advertising. It could be replaced on any of these axes (it has already started to be on most).</p>
<p>When startups consume incumbents, they usually start by serving some small but important market that the big players ignore.</p>
<p>Since the most successful startups generally ride some wave bigger than themselves, it could be a good trick to look for waves and ask how one could benefit from them.</p>
<h4>Ending thought:</h4>
<p>So for some final regards by me, the key to the startup idea is to be knowledgeable of the future, willing to create it by noticing the gaps in the world, but ignorant enough that I won't be deterred by the fear of doing something difficult. All of this isn't to say that you have to be an organic idea, pushing the envelope with some grit can work too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it sounds, that's the real recipe.</p>
