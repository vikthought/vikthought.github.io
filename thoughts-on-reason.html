<p>Reason is the bedrock of democracy the bedrock of human nature. It derives the qualities we most cherish. But above all, its the one aspect of ourselves we truly own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reason is built on information, and when our information is corrupted, not even reason can save us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I think of reason, I think of the stoics and their love of reason best encapsulated by another fellow, a Mr. Boethius</p>
<p>But I also think of man known to critique pure reason...yes, A Mr. Emmanuelle Kant.</p>
<p>My thoughts on reason lie on many dimensions, and questions. </p>
<p>I wonder what the relation is between this concept of reason to consciousness
I wonder how intrinsic reason is to our humanity?
I wonder what it means for other beings to encapsulate reason?
I wonder how we seem to assume that reason manifests in the same way for all beings?
I wonder why reason has been the backbone for all thought. 
I wonder what substitute exists for reason?</p>
