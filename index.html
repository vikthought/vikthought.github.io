</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>There has been something that over the past few days has given me cause to reflect. Religion has been and remains to this day to be one of those topics that outside of the proper academic or religous settings is often considered taboo in today's society.
Nonetheless, I ask that you take the time to consider the following thoughts as simply a means of attaining one primary goal, changing this status quo.</p>
<h3>Worship</h3>
<p>Worship could be argued to be at the core of religion. While faith can be for many, multiple different entities, the act of worship is a commonality that most who are religous practice in some way, shape or form.
Whenever my mind thinks about worship and religion, I am reminded not of my own faith, which I believe it best to remain anonymous as to protect any preconvieved notions I might cause, but instead to a speech given by a man who took his own life.</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace. Arguably one of the best novelists of the modern generation. And one of the first people I argue has given a commencement address worthy of what it means to have a commencement. In this now somewhat youtube famous commencement address, he spoke of worship.
He argued that people must worship something. Anything. And if someone doesn't worship a god, they still worship something, whether that be power, money, freedom. But what Wallace argues is that of all the things there are to worship, only god is safe.
One who worships money will never have enough, one who worships power will live a fate in line with a greek tragedy. And one who worships freedom will never find joy in a single place.</p>
<p>I would be amiss if I didn't acknowledge that there could be people who could be content worshiping the simple things in life. But even then, the idea of worshiping and susitence is something that I believe is a paradox in human psychology.</p>
<p>Worshiping god has its beneifts. And finding meaning in that worship is something that people may desire, but likely will remain, like worship, simply a unattainable quest.</p>
<h3>On God</h3>
<p>There's something special about god. Most religions define god as an energy, with the most true personified form manifesting in the individual who is themselves seeking god. A fascinating cycle in someways, as for many religions we are looking for something beyond ourselves and at the same time hoping that what is beyond ourselves is also realized within ourself.</p>
<p>I wonder to what degree to people seek god withing themselves, relative to alternative means of attaining such goals. </p>
<h3>On Life</h3>
<p>Faith's power is something that I think people lose sight of in today's world. To those who hold god on a pedastal, faith can lead to many completely disregarding how religion has at times prevented the steps we have taken as a species.
To those of the opposing opinion, I wonder if people realize how important the divine has been at acting as a basis, a driving force, for human endeavour.
Our lives are something that, when we look at both science and religion, can share the common opinion that every human life is a miracle. 
Yet we loose sight of these things when we believe there is present opposing opinions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I claim every human shares the same goals. I also claim that people lack the ability to realize the latter truth by virtue of our inherent, defensive and protective nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My proof for these claims I hope is apparent. And to those for which the proof is not, I ask you pause and ponder a counterclaim. As it is in that process that we often find the key to unlocking the truth.</p>                </article>
